        <h2>What is the major problem??</h2>
       
        <p>Humans have been a threat to the animal kingdom espicially animals which have become domesticated.<br>
            Homeless animals outnumber homeless people 5 to 1. <br> 
            There are 600 million unwanted animals in the world, and not enough people willing to take care of them. <br> 
             70 million of those animals are in the US which has a 318.6 million population (2014 census). <br>
             Even though the number of people is overwhelming, only 36-47% of households in the US have pets. <br>
           So where do the animals come from? Basically there are two different groups <b>:</b> <br> those who were abandoned by owners (both puppies and adult dogs) and those born in the street.
